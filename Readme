Programming Assignment 2-1
Use the Reference Example introduced in Lesson 2 as a starting point to create your own Customer class.
A Customer has a firstName, lastName, socSecurityNum (which you can represent as a String), a billingAddress and a shippingAddress. 
Define a Java class Customer that has these attributes and has a constructor, getter, and setter methods just like the Employee class 
in the Reference Example. You may re-use the Address class from the Reference Example â€“ billingAddress and shippingAddress
should both have type Address. Your Customer class should have a toString method that provides a string representation of the customer.
A typical toString output would be "[Joe, Smith, ssn: 332-221-4444]".
In the main method of a Main class, create two instances of Customer (be sure to create instances of Address to populate their billingAddress 
and shippingAddress fields). Add these instances to an array. Then loop through the array and print to the console all those
Customers whose billingAddress is located in the city of Chicago (when you create instances of Customer initially, be sure to create at
least one Customer whose billing address is in Chicago).

This project includes:
- Customer class
- Address Class
- App : main
- Junit Tests
